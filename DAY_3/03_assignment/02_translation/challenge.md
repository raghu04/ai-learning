# Challenge: Translation Mode

**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Focus**: System prompts, multiple API calls, language detection

## Challenge Description

Transform your basic chatbot into an intelligent translation assistant that can automatically detect languages and provide high-quality translations with cultural context.

## User Story

*"As a user, I want to type text in any language and have the chatbot automatically detect the language and offer to translate it to my preferred target language. The bot should also provide cultural context and alternative translations when relevant."*

## Requirements

### Core Features (Must Have)
- [x] **Language Detection**: Automatically identify the input language
- [x] **Translation**: Translate text to user-selected target language
- [x] **Language Selection**: Sidebar control for target language selection
- [x] **Bidirectional Translation**: Support translation in both directions

### Advanced Features (Nice to Have)
- [x] **Cultural Context**: Provide cultural notes for idiomatic expressions
- [x] **Alternative Translations**: Offer multiple translation options
- [x] **Confidence Scoring**: Show confidence level of detection/translation
- [x] **Translation History**: Keep track of translation pairs

## Technical Approach

You'll need to modify your existing chatbot to:

1. **System Prompt Engineering**: Create a specialized prompt for translation tasks
2. **Two-Stage Process**: First detect language, then translate
3. **State Management**: Track source/target languages in session state
4. **UI Enhancements**: Add language selection controls

## Key Objectives

- Use system prompt engineering
- Handle multiple API calls in sequence
- Implement conditional logic based on AI responses
- Create professional translation UX patterns

## Example Interactions

**Input**: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"
**Output**:
```
🔍 Detected Language: French
🎯 Translation (English): "Hello, how are you?"

💡 Cultural Note: This is a formal greeting in French. In casual settings,
   you might hear "Salut, ça va?" instead.
```

**Input**: "I love this weather"
**Output**:
```
🔍 Detected Language: English
🎯 Translation (Spanish): "Me encanta este clima"

🌟 Alternative: "Adoro este tiempo" (more emphatic)
